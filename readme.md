Requirements: Pygame

The project is consists of three main files.

part_1.py: This file implements Part 1 of the assignment, thereby drawing a wireframe of the given shape.

part_2.py: This file implements Part 2 of the assignment. It contains all the features performed in Part 1, plus the added functionality of shading the faces depending on the angle they form with the positive z-axis.

shape_generator.py: This file is used for generating more complicated shapes with the purpose of testing the renderings made in Part 1 and Part 2.

Mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication have been implemented by homemade functions. The program can be sped up by using built-in functions from libraries such as NumPy.

The images folder contains samples of renderings.

object.txt contains the provided sample to be rendered.

To execute the code, first install Pygame. Then, cd into the parent folder and type 'python3', followed by the 'part_1.py', or 'part_1.py'.
